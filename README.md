# Exploring-Depression-PCA-MCA
Data-driven exploration of depression using PCA and MCA on a questionnaire dataset. Analyzes demographic and symptom data to classify and understand depression impacts. Developed with R.

## Project Overview

"Explorer La DÃ©pression" aims to delve into the prevalent mental health disorder of depression, which affects millions globally. Utilizing a dataset constructed from a questionnaire targeting various socio-professional categories and age groups, the project applies advanced statistical techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) to uncover underlying patterns and associations in the data related to depression symptoms and demographic factors.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Investigation of a dataset consisting of 127 participants, using variables like age, gender, socio-professional status, and more.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Application of PCA to reduce dimensionality and identify key variables, and MCA to explore categorical data relationships.
- **Visualization**: Detailed visual representations of data distributions and analysis results, including pie charts for demographic breakdowns and ggplot2 visualizations for PCA and MCA findings.
- **Classification**: Implementation of hierarchical clustering to discover natural groupings within the data and k-means clustering to categorize data points into distinct clusters based on their characteristics.

## Objectives

The project specifically focuses on:
- Analyzing data using PCA to highlight the most significant symptoms and factors of depression.
- Utilizing MCA to explore how different categories relate to each other in the context of depression.
- Classifying individuals into groups based on their responses to gain insights into the varying degrees of depression symptoms experienced.

## Tools and Technologies

- R Programming Language
- ggplot2 for advanced visualizations
- Techniques like PCA, MCA, and clustering algorithms to analyze and interpret the data effectively.

## Repository Contents

- **Data**: Folder containing the anonymized questionnaire data.
- **Scripts**: R scripts for performing the analyses including PCA, MCA, and clustering.
- **Results**: Visualizations and summary reports of the findings.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations of the methodology, data handling, and conclusions.
